    <p>WurstCon is heading to St. Louis following <a href="http://tek.phparch.com/">php[tek]</a> on Friday, May 27, 2016. The conference wraps up around 1pm and we're aiming to head out shortly thereafter for a late lunch. The Gateway to the West may not be renowned for its sausage, but that doesn't mean we're out of options! We'll meet in the hotel lobby at 2pm to coordinate travel to <a href="http://steveshotdogsstl.com/">Steve's Hot Dogs On the Hill</a>. Whether you're in the mood for a loaded dog, local salsiccia, or something veggie, Steve's <a href="http://steveshotdogsstl.com/menu-steves-hot-dogs/">menu</a> should have you covered.</p>
