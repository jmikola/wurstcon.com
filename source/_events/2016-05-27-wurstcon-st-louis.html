    <p>WurstCon is heading to St. Louis following <a href="http://tek.phparch.com/">php[tek]</a> on Friday, May 27, 2016. The conference wraps up around 1pm and we're aiming to head out shortly thereafter for a late lunch. The Gateway to the West may now be renowned for its sausage, but that doesn't mean we're out of options! Local favorite <a href="http://steveshotdogsstl.com/menu-steves-hot-dogs/">Steve's Hot Dogs</a> is one possible venue we're considering. Stay tuned for more info!</p>
