    <p>After Sunshine PHP wraps up, all local vice squad agents are invited to <a href="http://sweetdogs.net/">Sweet Dogs</a>. Victor Ruiz and the gang are cooking up some truly unique creations from their kitchen in southwest Miami, and we're going to sample them all. Rumor has it that they also serve a mean Oreo milkshake.</p>
