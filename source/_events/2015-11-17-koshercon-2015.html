    <p>Did you know that every year, hundreds of people die from food related illnesses?</p>

    <p>That's pretty depressing. Do you know what isn't depressing?</p>

    <p>KosherCon is heading to the Char Bar in Washington, DC for this year's php[world]! Come on down and eat with our
    very own drinking rabbi, and a whole bunch of other people that you'll get to know, at the premiere Kosher-based
    event at php[world]!</p>
