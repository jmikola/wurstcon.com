    <p>The hotdog hats are invading Britishland! Join us after <a href="http://phpsouthcoast.co.uk">PHP South Coast</a> on Sunday, June 12, 2016 as we visit <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Thecraftyhotdogcompany/">The Crafty Hotdog Company</a>. By sheer, serendipitous coincidence, this shop opened June 4 -- just in time for PHP South Coast and our first, official English WurstCon. Their menu boasts a solid selection of gourmet sausages, craft beer, fair trade coffee, and organic soft drinks, which you won't want to miss. All are invited to meet at the venue at midday (i.e. noon for our colonial attendees).</p>
